                through <strong>China(Tibet region), India, and Pakistan.</strong>  In Tibet, it is known as Singi Khambai or Lion’s

                    </li>
                    <li>The Himalayan Rivers existed even before the formation of the Himalayas i.e. before
                        the&nbsp;<strong>collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian plate</strong>. {Antecedent
                        Drainage}</li>
                    <li>They were flowing into the&nbsp;<strong>Tethys Sea.</strong>&nbsp;These rivers had their source
                        in the now&nbsp;<strong>Tibetan region.</strong></li>
                    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>deep gorges</strong>&nbsp;of the Indus, the Satluj, the Brahmaputra, etc.
                        clearly indicate that these rivers are&nbsp;<strong>older than the Himalayas</strong>.</li>
                    <li>They continued to flow throughout the building phase of the Himalayas; their banks rising
                        steeply while the beds went lower and lower due to vertical erosion (Vertical down cutting was
                        significant and was occurring at a rate faster than the rising of Himalayas), thus cutting deep
                        gorges.</li>
                    <li>Thus, many of the Himalayan Rivers are typical examples of&nbsp;<strong>antecedent
                            drainage.</strong></li>
